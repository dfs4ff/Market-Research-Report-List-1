<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Composition Resistor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Carbon-Composition Resistors</li><li>Carbon-Film Resistors</li><li>Metal-Film Resistors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The composition resistor market comprises three main types: carbon-composition resistors, carbon-film resistors, and metal-film resistors. Carbon-composition resistors, made from a mixture of carbon and a binding material, offer high stability but have higher noise levels. Carbon-film resistors utilize a thin layer of carbon on an insulating substrate, providing improved performance and lower noise. Metal-film resistors, formed from a thin film of metal, deliver exceptional accuracy and stability, making them ideal for precision applications. Each type caters to specific performance needs in electronic circuits.</p></p>
